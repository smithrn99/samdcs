SAN ANDREAS MOBILE DATA COMPUTER SYSTEM

This is a software project meant to create a mock Mobile Data Computer system for use in GTA V roleplay policing scenarios.

It will probably be more of a logkeeping software than a real MDC simulation, but nonetheless, it will have capabilities of 
running vehicle tags and persons, creating, editing and storing calls, as well as other features that I haven't quite 
planned yet. The first stage of creating this software will be its NCIC functionality, which will run people/tags and store
them inside some sort of database. 

The plans for this software can be viewed at:
